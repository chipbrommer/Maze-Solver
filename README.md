# Maze-Solver

Created for USM Computer Science CSC 412 - Artificial Intelligence. 

This program was created for use of academic purposes. Feel free to use as desired but please give credit. 

This program will read in a 10x10 maze from a txt file. The maze must have a W for walls, P's for the path, E for the entrance, and X for the exit. The program will then use a Breadth First Search and Depth First Search to solve the maze. The algorithms are timed and the time is output at the end of each search. The program outputs the initial Maze, each possible move, and when it finds the exit, it will show the actual path taken, and then will print the path over-laying the original maze. 

All of this gets output to a convenient txt file automatically. 

This program is not complete and the algorithms could use some performance enhancing to speed them up and make them more efficent.
